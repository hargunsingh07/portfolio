                       <p> Hi, I am Hargun Singh, an aspiring Web Developer

                        at Red River College,Winnipeg , where i am building my foundation in the web development.

                        <p>I am currently working Part time at the Shell Gas Station as Customer Service Representative . As an international student is reallly hard to cope with the living expenses and the fees of College so to meeet the both ends i needed to do part time job .
                         i also manage to study along the job and do my assignments on time. But due to busy schedule sometimes i miss the deadlines of assignments but still i am standing strong and  managing all this stuff.
                        </p>
                        <br><h3>HOBBIES</h3><hr>
                        <p>
                         Apart from studies whenever i got free time i like to play Volleyball and Badminton with my College friends . I like outdoor activities such as biking , sporting and another outdoor stuff.
                         Apart from all this i am very fond of nature and love to explore new places such as parks ,beaches so as to satisfy me i go to nearby parks and inhale fresh air and also travel to different parks located in outer side of Winnipeg like Birdshill View Park,Asssiniboine park etc.
                        </p>
